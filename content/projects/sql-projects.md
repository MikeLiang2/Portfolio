This project builds a sample MySQL relational database system for the Boston Public Library. It supports management of library branches, collections, customers, employees, appointments, events, and schedules. The system follows 3rd Normal Form and implements various many-to-many and one-to-many relationships with auto-increment primary keys for efficient indexing.
